		<h2>Magenta Misery</h2><br>

		<p>How many hues of pink is a lip colour made of? The right ones reflect off eyes and dazzle. It's an open ended love story with careless eyes. We can only pity the meanderers. </p><br>

		<p>It has been 23 years and 14 days of a certain over cautiousness. Of course on a hurdle that's life such as this, one can never be too cautious. One can only dream and hope for salvation. It is a good time to be born guilty.</p><br>

		<h2>Kaleidoscopic Casualty</h2><br>

		<p class="indent">Have you ever wondered if songs bled poetry or it's the other way round? When you are one of the muses, it is your job to know what or whose heartbreak you're dealing with. There is no home for vagabonds like you.</p><br>

		<p>Sometimes you look at paintings and wonder if art was a refinery that you could've adapted yourself to. But you are stuck with verses in your head and guitars strumming lyrics. You, my dear, are the stuff good night's sleep is made of.</p><br>

		<h2>Endearing Enigma</h2><br>

		<p class="indent">How do some women take the hate out of your lungs and fill them with air? There were 56 point something souls on this street and everybody knew her name. And she knew their fears like the back of her hand.</p><br>

		<p>She makes homes out of houses. Yet she is the one who sleeps in her car, with the roof down, so she can see the stars every night. When rain falls, it does so gently, careful not to wake her up.</p><br>
